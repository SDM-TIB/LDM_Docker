<h3>1. Scope of Application</h3>

<p>
    1.1 These Special Conditions of the LDM regulate the use of the LDM as well as
    the rights and obligations of Registered Users and the TIB in addition to
    the Terms of Use of TIB.
</p>
<p>
    1.2 LDM is primarily aimed at scholars who want to share, explore and reuse research datasets in a novel manner.
    The LDM is built on top of <a href="http://docs.ckan.org/en/2.9/contents.html">CKAN</a> and LDM software is
    freely accessible to everyone.
</p>

<h3>2. Registration</h3>
<p>
    2.1 LDM datasets can be searched and explored without registration.
</p>
<p>
    2.2 The upload and description of dataset metadata require registration (Registered Users).
</p>
<p>
    2.3 An LDM dataset can be accessed following the access rights imposed by the Registered Users who are the dataset
    creators.
</p>
<p>
    2.4 There is no entitlement to registration, account, or profile. The TIB is entitled to reject registrations or
    terminate accounts if a violation of these Special Conditions LDM exists or is expected.
</p>
<p>
    2.5 When registering, users must agree to the Special Conditions of the LDM and
    the Data Protection Declaration. If these Special Conditions of the LDM are
    updated, Registered Users will be notified of the changes two weeks in
    advance by email. By subsequently continuing to use LDM, Registered Users
    agree to the changes.
</p>
<p>
    2.6 A usage relationship is established between the TIB and the Registered
    User through registration.
</p>
<p>
    2.7 When registering, users are obliged to fill in mandatory fields
    truthfully and completely, to keep their data up-to-date and secret and to
    protect data from access by third parties.
</p>
<p>
    2.8 Accounts may be terminated for cause by TIB. A cause can be a breach of
    the Terms of Use or these Special Conditions or a legal obligation or
    official order for TIB to block the access or any other conduct, which
    raises the suspicion that the user violates or will violate the Terms of
    Use, these Special Conditions or other legal obligations also in the future.
</p>
<p>
    2.9 TIB will terminate accounts at the request of the user in text form at
    any time and without undue delay. All personal data in the user profile will
    be deleted without undue delay. Content created by users remains published
    as long as the TIB does not delete this content or the user does not request
    its deletion, whereupon the TIB will anonymize this content.
</p>
<h3>3. LDM</h3>
<p>
    3.1 Anyone can view and use LDM content (the metadata of the LDM datasets). Registered Users can add datasets,
    and create and modify the metadata of their datasets.
</p>
<p>
    3.2 The source code is made available under the GNU Affero General Public v3.0 License.
</p>
<p>
    3.3 Registered Users confirm that the datasets they publish and the metadata they provide, do not infringe any
    third-party rights (e.g. copyright, rights of performers, personality and publicity rights, data protection). If
    others are involved in the production, Registered Users confirm that all participants are aware of the content of
    this agreement and have given their consent.
</p>
<p>
    3.4 Registered Users ensure that the datasets they publish and the metedata they provide, do not violate applicable
    law or offend common decency, in particular, they do not constitute a criminal offense and do not constitute an
    administrative offense (e.g. infringement of copyright, trademark law, competition law) or none have offensive,
    discriminatory, racist, pornographic or extremist content. In the event of a violation, Section 5 applies.
</p>
<p>
    3.5 If a user becomes aware of a violation of the law within the meaning of
    3.3 or 3.4 he / she is obliged to inform the TIB immediately.
</p>
<p>
    3.6 Registered Users will indemnify the TIB from all claims of other users
    or third parties that they assert against the TIB due to infringement of
    their rights through content published by the respective Registered User, if
    the respective user can be held responsible. The respective Registered User
    assumes the costs of an appropriate legal defense of the TIB. This does not
    apply if the Registered User is not responsible for the infringement. Users
    are obliged to provide all information necessary for the examination of the
    claims and a defense in the event of a claim against the TIB truthfully and
    completely without further delay.
</p>
<h3>4. Functionality of the LDM</h3>
<p>
    4.1 Anyone can use the LDM service to explore LDM datasets without registration. The metadata describing the
    LDM datasets can be reused freely for any purpose users see fit, in accordance with the CC BY-SA License
    (5.2 of these Special Conditions LDM). The LDM datasets can be reused following the regulations imposed by the
    license of the dataset, which is specified by the registered user who created the dataset in LDM.
</p>
<p>
    4.2 LDM provides functionality that requires registration. Adding and editing, including deleting, existing datasets
    and their metadata is reserved for Registered Users. Metadata about the LDM datasets is created and edited in
    accordance with the CC0 License (5.1 of these Special Conditions LDM). Registered Users obtain LDM user profiles,
    can link their profile to ORCiD; the profiles include provenance information.
</p>
<p>
    4.3 LDM provides programmatic access to the content (API). Anyone can use the LDM API to access existing content.
    Creating and editing, including deleting, existing content via the LDM API is reserved for Registered Users.
</p>
<p>
    4.4 LDM enables DOI-based publication of LDM datasets. In doing so, metadata including creator names and, if known,
    ORCiD IDs are shared with DataCite. If a Registered User publishes an LDM dataset in this form, she or he agrees to
    the sharing of metadata with DataCite. The sharing of such data is based on user consent given as part of the service
    of DataCite e. V. and ORCiD. Registered Users need to connect their LDM profile with ORCiD and need to explicitly
    activate DOI-based publication of the LDM datasets.
</p>
<h3>5. Rights and obligations of the TIB</h3>
<p>
    5.1 LDM dataset metadata created by Registered Users is licensed to TIB under the licence CC0 1.0 Universal
    (CC0 1.0 Public Domain Dedication).
</p>
<p>
    5.2 LDM dataset metadata created by Registered Users is published by TIB under Creative Commons
    Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.
</p>
<p>
    5.3 The TIB assumes no liability that the service and its content are always
    uninterrupted, unchanged and available in full, as well as being up-to-date
    and free from errors of an editorial or technical nature. No liability is
    accepted for damage caused by trusting the content of the platform or its
    use.
</p>
<p>
    5.4 The TIB reserves the right to change the functionality, the appearance
    and these Special Conditions of the LDM at any time. Registered Users will be
    informed of the changes two weeks in advance by email. By continuing to use
    the platform after the deadline, users agree to the changes.
</p>
<p>
    5.5 The TIB is entitled to terminate its service at any time. In this case,
    the TIB reserves the right to delete the content. However, this does not
    result in an obligation to delete the content.
</p>
<p>
    5.6 The TIB provides scientific information in all areas of engineering as
    well as chemistry, information technology, mathematics and physics to the
    public. If content by Registered Users does not satisfy the quality criteria
    TIB generally applies to scientific information, TIB may exclude the content
    from its services without prior notice.
</p>
<p>
    5.7 In principle, the TIB is only liable for damage caused by intent or
    gross negligence. In case of injuries to life, body or health statutory
    provisions apply.
</p>
<p>
    5.8 Liability for damage from unauthorized use of password-protected logins
    by third parties is not accepted.
</p>
<p>
    5.9 Insofar as liability is limited or excluded, this also applies in favor
    of executive employees (m / f), representatives (m / f) and vicarious agents
    (m / f) of the TIB.
</p>
<p>
    5.10 If there are concrete indications of a violation of these Special
    Conditions of the LDM, the TIB is entitled to delete content, restrict the use of
    the services or block the Registered User concerned. When choosing a
    measure, the legitimate interests of the Registered User are taken into
    account, in particular whether there are indications that the Registered
    User was not responsible for the violation.
</p>
<p>
    5.11 Content that contains a legal violation according to 3.3 or 3.4 may be
    blocked or deleted by the TIB.
</p>
<h3>6. Miscellaneous</h3>
<p>
    6.1 The usage relationship and these Special Conditions of the LDM are subject to
    German law.
</p>
<p>6.2 The place of jurisdiction is Hannover.</p>
<p>
    6.3 In the event of a dispute, the TIB endeavors to reach an amicable
    settlement.
