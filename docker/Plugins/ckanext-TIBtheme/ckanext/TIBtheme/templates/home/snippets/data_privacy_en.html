 <h2 id="TextbausteinefürDatenschutzerklärung-PrivacyStatement">Privacy Statement</h2>
            <p>Data protection is of high priority for the Technische Informationsbibliothek (TIB). As a general rule,
                the use of TIB’s services does not require the provision of any personal data. However, the processing
                of personal data may be required where a data subject wants to use special services via the TIB’s
                web pages. Where the processing of personal data is required and where there is no legal basis for such
                processing, we shall obtain the data subject’s consent.
            </p>
            <p>The processing of personal data, such as for example the data subject’s name, address, email address, or
                telephone number shall always be carried out in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation
                (GDPR) and the state and institution-specific data protection rules and regulations applicable to the
                TIB. This privacy statement serves to inform the public about the nature, scope and purpose of the
                personal data we collect, use and process, as well as of the rights data subjects are entitled to.
            </p>
            <p>The terms used in this privacy statement are to be understood within the meaning of the

                to TIB newsletters and newsletter tracking</h3><p>Users can subscribe to newsletters via the TIB web
                pages in order to receive information on offers and news at regular intervals. This shall require
                registration providing title, name and email address. Using the double opt-in procedure, a confirmation
                email shall be sent to the email address first registered by a data subject for the purpose of receiving
                the newsletter, in order to check whether the owner of the email address has authorised receipt of the
                newsletter.
            </p>
            <p>When registering for the newsletter, TIB stores the IP address of the computer system used by the data
                subject at the time of registration, as well as the date and time of the registration. Collection of
                this data is necessary in order to be able to trace any (possible) misuse of the email address of a data
                subject at a later date.</p><p>The personal data collected during registration for a newsletter are used
                exclusively for the purpose of sending the newsletter. In addition, subscribers of the newsletter can be
                informed by email if this is necessary for the operation of the newsletter service, e.g. in the event of
                changes in content or technical aspects of the newsletter. The personal data collected for sending the
                newsletter will not be passed on to third parties. Subscription to the TIB newsletter can be terminated
                by the data subject at any time. Consent to the storage of personal data for sending the newsletter can
                be withdrawn at any time. For the purpose of withdrawal of consent a link is provided in each newsletter.
                Furthermore, it is possible to unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time directly on the website of the
                controller or to inform the controller thereof in any other way.
            </p>
            <p>The TIB newsletters contain so-called tracking pixels. A tracking pixel is a miniature graphic embedded
                in emails sent in the HTML format to enable log file recording and log file analysis. Based on the
                embedded tracking pixel, the Technische Informationsbibliothek (TIB) is able to identify if and when an
                email was opened by a data subject, and which links in the email were clicked.
            </p>
            <p>This information is stored and evaluated by the TIB in order to optimise the distribution &nbsp;and the
                content of the newsletter. Data subjects may withdraw the declaration of consent given via the double
                opt-in procedure. Following withdrawal, this personal data will be deleted by the TIB. TIB shall construe
                any unsubscribing of the newsletter to constitute a withdrawal.
