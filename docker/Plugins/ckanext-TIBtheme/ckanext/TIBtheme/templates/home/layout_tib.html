          <p>The TIB Data Manager prototype was developed to support the aspect of better re-usability of research data. The prototype supports the management and access to heterogeneous research data publications and assists researchers in the selection of relevant data sets for their respective disciplines.</p>
          <p>The prototype currently offers the following functions for the visualization of research data:
          <br>·         Supports data collections and publications with different formats.
          <br>·         Different views on the same data set (2D and 3D support).
          <br>·         Visualization of Auto CAD files.
          <br>·         Jupyter Notes for demonstrating live code.
          <br>·         RDF Description of data collections.
