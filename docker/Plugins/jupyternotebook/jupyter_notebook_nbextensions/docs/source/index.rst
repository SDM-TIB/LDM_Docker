Unofficial Jupyter Notebook Extensions
======================================

The ``jupyter_contrib_nbextensions`` package contains a collection of
community-contributed unofficial extensions that add functionality to the
Jupyter notebook.
These extensions are mostly written in Javascript and will be loaded locally
in your browser.

The
`IPython-contrib repository <https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions>`__
is maintained independently by a group of
users and developers and not officially related to the IPython
development team.

The maturity of the provided nbextensions varies, so please `create an
issue <https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions/issues/new>`__
at the project's `github
repository <https://github.com/ipython-contrib/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions>`__
if you encounter any problems.
