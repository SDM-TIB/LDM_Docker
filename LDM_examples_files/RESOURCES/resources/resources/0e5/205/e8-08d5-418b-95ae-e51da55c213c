I liked the KeyOntLLM work, it is working very well. The KeyLLM identifies the facets very well but fails to categorize phrases w.r.t facets with good accuracy. However, KeyOntLLM somehow manages to improve KeyLLM by categorizing keyphrases under appropriate facets -- it is a good improvement.  It doesn't need to be mentioned that (I can say that) KeyOnt is just making facets and not categorizing them. Considering my observation, I think it is worth using KeyOntLLM.

Just out of curiosity, it looks like you are using keyphrases to generate a two-level taxonomy, I am wondering if is there any notion behind this? "
